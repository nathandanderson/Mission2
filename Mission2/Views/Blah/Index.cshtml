<p>
    I have absolutely loved all of my programming classes thus far and am very excited to add another programming language to my resume!
    I currently want to go into development when I graduate and I've been wanting to learn a strongly typed language, this is going to be a great
    opportunity. I am also excited to be using a different program to write the code so that I can increase my experience with different applications!
